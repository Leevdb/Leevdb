- 👋 Hi, I’m @Leevdb, I consider myself a noob with a great attitude ^_^
- 👀 I’m interested in programming and learning more about game development.  Games and Game dev are my true passion.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, Java, JS, C#, C++, and all about OOP programming.  
- I graduated with distinction with a Bachelor of Information Technology in 2022 .. woo!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on game projects.  I am a doer, but I can also be an organiser when needed, I like project management and keeping teams on track.
